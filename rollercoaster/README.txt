This was straightforward.  The example grid was given at the top of
the puzzle.

The x/y indexing was a little disjointed in the solution, hence the
trans() function.  Unfortunate, but it was easier than redoing all of
the coordinate ordering.

The path was input as starting coordinates, and then X/Y distances to
travel.

Run, spin the resulting object around to look at it from the sides,
and you get the answer.
